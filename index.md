## About Me

I am a Cloud Engineer specialising in building, automating, and optimising cloud platforms. My work focuses on delivering scalable infrastructure, improving system reliability, and ensuring cost-efficient operations through practices such as right-sizing workloads, consistent resource tagging, reserved instances, and automation to reduce waste.

I began my career building and hosting brochure-style websites, managing infrastructure, and administering Windows, Linux, and SharePoint environments. Over time, I moved into software development, creating APIs in Azure and applying Infrastructure as Code practices. Today, I focus on automation, site reliability engineering, and financial operations, leveraging my end-to-end experience to bridge application development, infrastructure operations, and cost optimisation.

Outside of work, I am passionate about Internet of Things (IoT) and smart home technologies. I run a Home Assistant platform and am developing a replacement system for home ventilation (HRV) using MQTT and ESP devices. My approach is to build a smart home that operates in parallel with the original system, ensuring that if the smart setup is offline, the traditional manual controls continue to function without interruption.

I am currently studying the **Post Graduate Program in DevOps with Purdue University**, which covers DevOps fundamentals, Agile methodologies, source control with Git, continuous integration using Jenkins, configuration management with Ansible, containerisation with Docker, orchestration using Kubernetes, monitoring, and DevOps practices on AWS.

## Core Expertise

**Cloud and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
Engineering complex Azure environments with Terraform and Ansible, including API Management, Azure Front Door and WAF, Azure Virtual Desktop, container services, Logic Apps, secure networking, and DNS. I design modular infrastructure code for standardised deployments.

**Automation and CI/CD**  
Automating builds, tests, and deployments with Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions. Creating workflow automation with PowerShell, Ansible, and Azure Logic Apps to reduce manual tasks and increase delivery speed.

**Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**  
Designing and implementing observability systems with Grafana, InfluxDB, Azure Application Insights, and Log Analytics. Defining and monitoring SLIs/SLOs to track availability and performance, applying incident management practices to shorten MTTR and improve service reliability.

**FinOps Practices**  
Optimising cloud spend through right-sizing workloads, reserving instances, applying consistent tagging, and automating non-production shutdown schedules.

**Security and Compliance**  
Deploying and enforcing security policies through Microsoft Intune and Defender. Applying STIG baselines to meet compliance requirements and harden systems against threats.

## Selected Projects

**[go-batect](https://github.com/durankeeley/go-batect)**  
A single-binary Go replacement for Batect, enabling developers to define and run isolated tasks in Docker via YAML. Simplifies local development and CI workflows under an “Environment as Code” model.

**[Terraform vBridge Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/durankeeley-org/vbridge/latest)**  
A custom Terraform provider for the Softsource vBridge IaaS platform. Built in Go using the Terraform plugin SDK, enabling Infrastructure as Code for a previously unsupported provider.
